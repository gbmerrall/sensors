# PROJECT BRIEF: Sensors Dashboard System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive dashboard system for monitoring temperature, humidity, and battery data from multiple IoT sensors across different locations. The system provides real-time data visualization with advanced querying capabilities, dynamic data aggregation, and multi-location support.

## Business Objectives
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Provide real-time visualization of sensor data across multiple locations
2. **Data Analysis**: Enable advanced querying and analysis of historical sensor data
3. **Multi-Location Support**: Support monitoring of sensors across different physical locations
4. **Performance Optimization**: Deliver fast, responsive data visualization even with large datasets
5. **User Experience**: Provide intuitive, responsive interface for data exploration

## Key Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Personnel monitoring sensor data across locations
- **System Administrators**: Managing dashboard deployment and maintenance
- **Data Analysts**: Using the system for historical data analysis
- **IoT Sensor Operators**: Understanding sensor performance and battery status

## Success Criteria
- Dashboard displays temperature and humidity data with <3 second load time
- Multi-location data visualization with user-selectable locations
- Date range query functionality with timezone awareness
- Dynamic aggregation methods (interpolation vs averaging)
- Real-time statistics calculation and display
- Manual refresh capability with visual feedback
- Responsive design working on desktop and mobile devices
- 90%+ test coverage for critical functionality

## Project Constraints
- Must use existing SQLite database with current schema
- SSH connection required for database access (192.168.86.250)
- Must handle Pacific/Auckland timezone conversion
- Python 3.13 environment with pipenv dependency management
- Performance requirements: <1 second chart rendering, <2 second query response

## Technical Requirements
- Web-based dashboard using Plotly Dash framework
- Real-time data processing with pandas
- Timezone-aware datetime handling with pytz
- Intelligent caching system with LRU eviction
- Responsive UI design with mobile support
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- SSH tunnel management for secure database access

## Project Phases
1. **Foundation Setup** (Week 1): Project structure, environment, SSH connections
2. **Data Processing Engine** (Week 2-3): Timezone processing, aggregation, caching
3. **Dashboard Interface** (Week 4-5): Basic layout, charts, statistics boxes
4. **Advanced Features** (Week 6-7): Date range queries, multi-location support
5. **Testing & Optimization** (Week 8): Comprehensive testing, performance optimization

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Performance with large datasets, SSH connection reliability
- **Medium Risk**: Responsive UI complexity, timezone handling edge cases
- **Low Risk**: Standard Python development, testing framework setup

## Architecture Alignment
This project follows a layered architecture approach:
- **Presentation Layer**: Dash web interface with responsive design
- **Business Logic Layer**: Data processing, aggregation, and statistics
- **Data Access Layer**: SSH connection management and database queries
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Caching, error handling, logging, timezone processing
